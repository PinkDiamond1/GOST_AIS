# Processing Shipping Data
AIS shipping data record the location of all ships, all-day, every-day, globally. This has the potential to reveal a number of interesting trends or features of global trade:

- Identify commercially viable inland water bodies.
- Identify popular shipping routes, broken down by date and ship type.
- Identify imtermediate ports that serve as waypoints on longer routes.
